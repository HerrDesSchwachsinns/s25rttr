This is a fork of **Settlers II - Return to the Roots** (aka Settlers 2.5).
S25RTTR is a re-programming of the popular Settlers II, using only the graphics sprites and data blobs from the original, but implementing the game logic newly, allowing you to make use of newer features like higher resolutions and better graphics drivers.

The official website can be found at http://www.siedler25.org

This fork will be used to play around with the source and try to make improvements. Some or all of our changes may be included into the official s25rttr ("upstream") repository, but that is not our main goal. We're mostly trying to improve the game we love to play and expand our programming knowledge at the same time.

S25RTTR is released under the GNU GPL
